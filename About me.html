                    Hello, I'm Marc, I am an inspiring programmer and if you'll ask me why I chose to learn to program or I would say programming because I'd 
                    <br>
                    enjoyed programming or typing HTML syntax since I started to learn it, and I like to learn more than HTML syntaxes like java, python, and more. 
                    <br>
                    In college, I was planning to get BS Esport, or IT. The difference between them is on BS Esport you're focusing on the game, your not gonna play 
                    <br>
                    but they'll teach you how to make, understanding physics of the game and logic of a simple game, but in IT I think it's more on Data analytics 
                    <br>
                    and logic of a simple game, but in IT I think it's more on Data analytics and more. I was thinking CS or Computer science, I searched for jobs 
                    <br>
                    covered by CS or Computer Science and came up with web development and Software development, and I said that Computer Science was most 
                    <br>
                    likely close to what I'm doing so that's why I have three choices in college and I hope that I'll pick the right one for me. Now back to me,
                    <br>
                    I'm Currently 14 and my birthday is on October 18, 2007. I lived in Bulacan, Philippines. My dream job is to be a programmer. That's all, thank you
